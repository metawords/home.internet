Wireless internet uses the same towers as your cell phone but offers so much more — even reduced lag time.

Once you bring the device home, it functions just like a typical router, but with even easier set-up. Just plug it in and activate your service, and, in minutes, you’ll have a secure, private internet connection for your home with WiFi that can typically support multiple devices.



## What’s the Difference Between Wireless Internet and Fiber Internet?


Both types of high-speed internet will get you online, but they serve different purposes. Wireless home internet is a new type of internet connection that functions very similarly to a mobile phone data plan. When you sign up for it, you choose a monthly data plan, rather than selecting a speed. It focuses on getting internet access to areas where wired fiber internet (or other high-speed internet options) just isn’t available. Let’s break it down even more.

If you’re in an area where fiber internet is available, that will always be the best option. But if you’re currently stuck with spotty cable, DSL, or satellite internet, wireless internet is likely a much better choice. It’s more affordable and more reliable than satellite and faster than both satellite and DSL.
